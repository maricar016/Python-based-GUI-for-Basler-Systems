# Python-based-GUI-for-Basler-Systems
This program was developed for the Translational Optical Imaging (TOI) Laboratory in the University of Arizona. This program allows the user to view live data collection from any Basler sensors. Different versions of this program also allow users to integrate a motor driven by Pololu motor drivers and an ESP32-based remote.
